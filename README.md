## About

This is a very simple real-time chat client app made with react and firebase.

It is intended to serve as a demo for my portfolio, so the chat servers are hardcoded and all messages are erased each day at midnight.

### Built With

Here are some of the libraries and frameworks I used.

- React (create-react-app)
- Tailwindcss 2.0
- Firebase

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

A recent version of node and yarn.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. Start the project
   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

## Roadmap

I may come back in the future and implement more features for the client.
But for right now, this is a pretty simple and self contained example.
